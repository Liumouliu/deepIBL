# Stochastic Attraction-Repulsion Embedding for Large Scale Localization

This contains the code and model for training ground-view geo-localization method described in: Stochastic Attraction-Repulsion Embedding for Large Scale Localization, ICCV2019. 





This code is developed based on MatConvNet.

You first need to download the NetVLAD code (https://github.com/Relja/netvlad), then run our training methods.
